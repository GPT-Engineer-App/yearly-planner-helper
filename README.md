# yearly-planner-helper

MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Features




Yearly Planner with Daily Subdivisions:




Develop a yearly planner where the smallest time unit is a day.
Enable users to mark specific events or tasks for each day (e.g., "On this day I celebrate this event so I can't do other tasks").
Schedule Overlap Detection:




Implement a feature allowing users to see overlapping schedules if family and friends also use the planner.
Example: Notify users of schedule conflicts (e.g., "You plan to travel to Bacau from July 5-12, but your parents are away in Suceava from July 3-17, so you might want to reconsider your plans").
Category Layers:




Integrate category layers such as Important Dates (e.g., anniversaries), Vacations, and Client Meetings/Jobs.
Allow events to span multiple days, weeks, or even months (e.g., spanning 1-2-3-7 weeks).
Provide an overview of available work slots.
V1 Features




Google Calendar Synchronization:




Add functionality to sync the planner with Google Calendar.
Day-Level Granularity:




Implement a system to manage tasks and events at a daily granularity.
Transform the Yearly Planner into a Life Planner with detailed daily schedules.
Category and Subcategory Management:




Allow users to create general categories such as Personal Development.
Enable the addition of subcategories like TV Shows, Movies, Books, Games, etc.
Allow users to input specific content within subcategories (e.g., watch "Joker", read "Million Dollar Weekend", play "Witcher 3").
Time Management Calculation:




Integrate a feature to calculate the time needed to complete tasks based on user-specific data (e.g., working hours, commute time, reading speed).
Provide feedback when planned activities exceed available free time (e.g., "You have 2 hours of free time daily, totaling 720 hours yearly, but your current plans exceed this limit").








Technology Stack












Scalability:




Ensure the application supports large volumes of users by implementing scalable database solutions (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Use Django's built-in support for caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to handle high traffic.
Implement load balancing and use a web server like Nginx or Apache to distribute the load efficiently.








Event-Driven Architecture:




Use Django Channels for handling WebSockets and background tasks to make the backend event-driven.
Implement Celery for managing asynchronous tasks and background processes, ensuring smooth event handling.
AI Assistant Integration:








User Authentication and Authorization:




Implement user registration, login, and password management using Django's authentication system.
Ensure role-based access control to manage permissions.








Event Management:




Create models to handle events, categories, and subcategories with relationships between them.
Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing events and schedules.








Conflict Detection:




Develop algorithms to detect and notify users of schedule conflicts.
Provide suggestions for resolving conflicts based on user preferences and availability.
Calendar Synchronization:




Integrate with Google Calendar API for syncing events.
Ensure seamless two-way synchronization to keep calendars up-to-date.
Detailed Planning:




Allow users to break down their schedules into smaller tasks and manage them daily.
Implement features to input specific content within subcategories and track progress.
AI Assistant Features:




Develop a virtual assistant to analyze user data (working hours, commute time, reading speed) and suggest optimal schedules.
Use predictive analytics to forecast potential over-commitments and notify users.
Provide personalized recommendations for achieving goals (e.g., time management tips, activity prioritization).
User Interface:




Design a user-friendly and responsive interface using Django templates, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (possibly with a front-end framework like React or Vue.js) combined with flowbite
Implement drag-and-drop functionality for easy event management.
Notifications and Reminders:




Implement email and push notifications for upcoming events and potential conflicts.
Allow users to customize notification settings.
Data Privacy and Security:




Ensure all user data is encrypted and securely stored.
Implement GDPR compliance measures for handling user data.
Use HTTPS for secure communication between the client and server.
Performance Optimization:




Optimize database queries and use indexing to improve performance.
Implement caching strategies to reduce server load and improve response times.
